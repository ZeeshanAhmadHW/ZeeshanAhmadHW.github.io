question 1:

I simply followed the instructions given in the pdf up until the javascript, my first dozen attempts failed at creating an image 
carousel due to syntax and logic errors, but i got it right after help from the internet alongside logical thinking of code.

question 2: 

I copied the given css unto a new html file and built the structure of the form in a way that follows the css, after which i started on
the javascript, creating multiple functions and linking each to its appropriate tag in the html. At first i had numerous difficulties
in syntax and logic, syntax i was able to fix by looking into proper dom syntax online and logic by logical thinking of the code.
